# Welcome to LAB347

In this lab, you’ll work through four hands-on exercises designed to build your skills with Azure and intelligent app development. Below is an overview of each exercise:

1. [**Exercise 1**](./LabInstructions/Exercise-1.md) - Get started with intelligent app development by learning to use the [Azure OpenAI SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.openai-readme?view=azure-dotnet) to call the [Chat Completions API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.openai-readme?view=azure-dotnet#chat-completion), leveraging the GPT-4o-mini model and deploy to Azure App Service.
